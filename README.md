In my final project of [TDT4265](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4265#tab=omEmnet), my goal is to detect objects in traffic from LIDAR images collected around the NTNU campus. The sample image below is an example of how the dataset looks like.

![sample_image](docs/sample_image.jpg)
> The image is a three-channel image from a 360&deg; 128-channel LIDAR. The image is separated into depth of the scene (top row), ambience, and intensity (the return of the laser beam, bottom row). The images have a resolution of 128 × 1024 and are stored as 8-bit 3-channel images.
