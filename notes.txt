FocalLossPaper



huber loss (robust loss)
- reduce the contribution of outliers by down-weighting the loss of examples with large errors (hard examples).

focal loss: 
- addresses class imbalance by down-weighting inliers (easy examples)
  such that their contribution to the total loss is small even if their number is large.

robust vs focal:
the focal loss performs the opposite role of a robust loss:
it focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples
